Why use dynamic naming on mutations in store?

Was port difference between docker and vite an intended easter egg?

Having trouble getting styles to match up vs default vuetify component styles.  Need to figure out how custom styles modify that.

I feel like store modules should all be in a single store directory/submodule/module-name.store.js
